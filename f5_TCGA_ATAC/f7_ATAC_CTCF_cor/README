====
f0_union_binding_RPKM_pattern  
====

	get the CTCF/ATAC binding RPKM on union CTCFs
		-- union binding sites
		-- centered at motif position with 200bp expand on each side
		
	get the CTCF/ATAC binding pattern on union CTCFs
		-- centered at motif position, 1000bp each side with 100 bins (per 20bp = 2kb/100)


====
f1_compr_NoDnaMe_withMotif
====

	init comparison of CTCF vs. ATAC RPKM on 
	-- union CTCFs
	-- No Jurkat DNA methylation
	-- with motif
	-- overlap ATAC peaks


====
f2_compr_by_JurkatCTCF_by_motif_score
====

	separate CTCF binding by
	-- if overlapped Jurkat CTCfs
	-- using motif cutoff 1e-6

====
f3_TF_enrichment_analysis
====

	for those open chromatin, with motif, no DNA methylation, no CTCF binding regions
	do a bart based TF enrichemtn analysis
