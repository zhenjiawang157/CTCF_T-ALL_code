	use cancer specific ATAC peaks (panCancer overlap peak from each cancer type) overlap cancer specific CTCFs

f2_cancer_specific_CTCF_accessibility_panCancer  
f4_clinical_survival_panCancer
	use panCancer ATAC peaks overlap cancer specific CTCFs
	
f5_TALL_ATAC_RPKM
f6_TALL_ATAC_raw_count
	ATAC results comparing Jurkat vs. CD4



f7_ATAC_CTCF_cor
	check if at open chromatin regions with CTCF motif present, ATAC-seq signal should highly correlate with CTCF ChIP-seq signal.
	In other words, check if sites that (are highly accessible chromatin) & (CTCF motif) & (no DNA methylation) & (do not bind by CTCF) exist.
