averaged mutation rate for piped up CTCFs
then further averaged within each bin

==
T_ALL

results on new union CTCFs, but the mutations were called using old union CTCFs




==
T_ALL_new

results on new union CTCFs using newly called mutation results

The zipped folder ctcf_sites_output.tar.gz has the updated alterations in each cell line that overlap the new binding sites. The columns in the files are the chromosome, 1-based position on hg38, reference allele, alternate allele, and genotype call for the sample.

 I am attaching an updated CTCF gene mutation list too. Most of the stuff in this should be unchanged, but I used the updated annotations (cache version 95 for Ensembl). The “Consequence” column annotates the mutations based on this dictionary: https://useast.ensembl.org/info/genome/variation/prediction/predicted_data.html. “HGVSp” tells you about the protein change (if any). “Exsiting variation” refers to Rs numbers in dbSNP, or COSM numbers in COSMIC if this variant is seen elsewhere. MAX_AF is the maximum allele frequency of the variant in any population group in 1000 Genomes, ExAC and gnomAD. CADD_PHRED is the phred-scaled measure of deleteriousness. MOTIF_ are some annotations pertaining to regulatory variants, which in this case are not found. Remember this is the canonical transcript which is ENST00000646076.  

Also attached is another excel spreadsheet for NOTCH1 (canonical transcript ENST00000277541) with the same columns.
