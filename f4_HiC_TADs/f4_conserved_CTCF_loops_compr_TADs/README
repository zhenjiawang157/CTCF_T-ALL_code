====
generate domain boundaries from Hi-C data
====
hic_domain_merged file was generated using Hi-C boundaries(40kb bin) generated from 21 cell lines
then merge those regions within 200kb with each other


====
collect domain boundary constitutive CTCFs
& merge into putative boundaries
====

collect all constitutive CTCFs that are directly used as domain boundaries in our prediction

THEN

to keep consistency, merge all constitutive boundaries using same criteria
-- extend to 40kb bin
-- merge bins within 200kb with each other

====
overlap between Hi-C boundaries and constitutive CTCF boundaries
====
