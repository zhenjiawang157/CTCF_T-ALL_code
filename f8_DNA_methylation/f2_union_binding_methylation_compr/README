f1_signal_binding_csv                        
	for each CTCF binding and for each data
	get the methylation states in a 300bp region centered at CTCF

f2_union_binding_differential_DNA_methylation
	compare the differential methylation state
	-- keep loci show methylation state/score in both cancer and normal data
	-- keep record of #loci with differential me. state
	-- calculate the averaged diff. me. score within the recorded #loci 

py3_methy_compr_add_UnCoScored_regions.py
	-- same as in py2
	-- keep tag of those regions do not have co-scored CpG
        -- #UnionScored is used as #loci with score in either cancer or normal data within 300bps
