f9_dynamicNOTCH_gained_CTCF_gene_expr
	gene expression changed in T-ALL vs. T cell of
	all genes vs. 
	dynamic NOTCH intra-domain genes vs. 
	dynamic NOTCH + gained CTCF intra-domain genes 

	gene expression changes in shCTCF vs. ctrl of 
	dynamic NOTCH + gained CTCF intra-domain genes, by whether 
	dynamic NOTCH and gained CTCF has increased Hi-C interaction
